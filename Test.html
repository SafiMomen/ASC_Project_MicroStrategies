                    ❌ Assume they are telling the truth because it's better to be a victim of a insensitive joke than have a suicidal friend think you don't take them seriously.
                </span>
            </h4>

            <h4 class="right choice"> “I’m so glad you told me that you’re thinking of suicide.”
                <span style="color: white; opacity: 100%;" class="altText">

                <span style="color: white; opacity: 100%;" class="altText">
                    ✅ This invitation to the suicidal person to tell their story can provide validation, engender a sense of connection, and show that you really want to understand. Show empathy.
                </span>

                <span style="color: white; opacity: 100%;" class="altText">
                    ❌ Are you serious? This is an obvious no-no. Saying this to someone suicidal is the absolute worst thing you can say and if you say it, you're pushing them over the edge and becoming a reason for them to commit suicide.

                <span style="color: white; opacity: 100%;" class="altText">
                    ✅ A death of a loved one, especially a parent can cause depression and lead to suicidal thoughts. Suicide doesn't take the pain away, it just passes it on to another person.
                </span>
            </h4>

            <h4 class="right choice"> Someone made a bad investment that made them lose all their money.
                <span style="color: white; opacity: 100%;" class="altText">
                    ✅ Losing a lot of money is terrible and can make anybody greatly stressed and/or depressed, but losing all your money because of a bad idea on your part will surely cause suicidal and pessimistic thoughts to arise in most people.
                </span>
            </h4>

            <h4 class="right choice"> Someone loses all their motivation and isolate themselves from everyone else.
                <span style="color: white; opacity: 100%;" class="altText">
                    ✅ This is a common symptom of depression, and if depression persists, suicide becomes a common act.

            <h4 class="right choice"> A person is bullied every day at school.
                <span style="color: white; opacity: 100%;" class="altText">
                    ✅ Bullying is a leading cause of suicide around the world. It causes the victim to develop depression, feel like the world is agaisnt him

                <span style="color: white; opacity: 100%;" class="altText">
                    ✅ This is the National Emergency Suicide Hotline. If you are ever feeling suicidal, please dial this number and call it.

            <h4 class="wrong choice"> Do nothing and hope the suicidal thoughts go away.
                <span style="color: white; opacity: 100%;" class="altText">
                    ❌ You can't just hope and pray that the suicidal thoughts go away, it's not that easy unfortunately. You must speak to someone you're comfortable with or to someone who knows what you're going through and can empathize.
                </span>
            </h4>

            <h4 class="right choice"> Do something that makes you feel good.
                <span style="color: white; opacity: 100%;" class="altText">
                    ✅ Doing stuff that make you feel good like exercising can be very helpful when dealing with suicidal thoughts because your brain releases endorphin, oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine. These are "feel good" chemicals that'll help fight those negative thoughts.
                </span>
            </h4>

            <h4 class="wrong choice"> Embrace and believe the suicidal thoughts.
                <span style="color: white; opacity: 100%;" class="altText">
                    ❌ Never. Never embrace those thoughts because their only going to worsen you and make you even more suicidal. If you can't stop embracing these thoughts, immediately call the suicide hotline or talk to someone. Remember, if you commit suicide, you're not getting rid of the pain, you're just passing it on to someone else that holds you dearly.
